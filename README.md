# classification-models
This repository features logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, kernel SVM, naive bayes, decision tree classification, and random forest classification. The programs featured make predictions based off of learning and training from prior similar datasets, and this helps the models forecast values for new data they're fed.
